# 🇪🇺 Project Rules — ComplyEur (EU 90/180 Employee Travel Tracker)
# Local-only HR compliance web app — built with privacy & simplicity in mind

project:
  name: ComplyEur
  description: >
    ComplyEur is a secure, local-only web app that helps UK companies
    track employee travel days within the Schengen Area to comply with
    the EU 90/180 rule.
  tech_stack:
    - Backend: Python (Flask)
    - Database: SQLite (local)
    - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Testing: Playwright, Bash automation
  data_policy:
    - Store only essential employee data (name + travel dates + country)
    - No tracking, analytics, or cookies beyond functional ones
    - GDPR-compliant at all stages
  ui_principles:
    - Simple, clean, minimal design (Apple-style minimalism)
    - Use tables, dropdowns, and color-coded indicators
    - Colours: Green (safe), Orange (approaching limit), Red (exceeded)
  structure:
    - /backend → Flask routes, logic
    - /frontend → Templates, static assets, JS
    - /database → SQLite DB and migrations
    - /tests → Playwright + automated QA scripts
    - /scripts → Bash helpers (run_tests.sh, backup_db.sh)
    - /reports → Output summaries (CSV/PDF)
  build_guidelines:
    - Each feature should be implemented in phases (e.g., 3.6.1, 3.6.2)
    - Each phase ends with automated test scripts and summary output
    - Keep all references to “IES” removed — ComplyEur branding only
  coding_standards:
    - Follow PEP8 for Python and ESLint defaults for JS
    - Comment functions clearly with docstrings
    - Always validate date inputs and country codes
    - Use consistent naming: snake_case (Python), camelCase (JS)
  security_principles:
    - Passwords hashed (bcrypt or Argon2)
    - Local-only authentication (no cloud auth)
    - Role-based access planned (admin only for MVP)
    - HTTPS when deployed via IONOS
  compliance:
    - 100% GDPR compliant
    - No tracking, ads, or unnecessary cookies
    - Privacy-first UX
