ComplyEur rebranding cleanup:
- Searched repository for standalone "IES" references and brand phrases; none remained outside substrings in unrelated words.
- Updated version headers to include ComplyEur branding:
  - CHANGELOG_PRODUCTION.md
  - backups/phase_3.4_cleanup_20251029_120414/DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md
  - backups/phase_3.4_cleanup_20251029_120414/README_PRODUCTION.md
  - docs/CHANGELOG.md
- No files or directories required renaming.
- Integrity check: attempted `pytest -q` (venv) but command unavailable; further testing deferred.
