      "content": "Understanding the 90/180 rule is crucial for compliance. Here's how it works:\n\n**The Rule:**\nUK citizens can spend a maximum of 90 days in the Schengen Area within any 180-day period.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n• **Rolling Window**: The 180-day period moves every day\n• **Schengen Area**: 26 European countries with no internal border controls\n• **Counting Days**: Only days physically present in Schengen countries count\n• **Ireland**: Tracked separately - doesn't count toward the 90-day limit\n\n**How We Calculate:**\n1. Look at the last 180 days from today\n2. Count all days spent in Schengen countries\n3. Show remaining days available\n4. Flag if approaching or exceeding the limit\n\n**Important Notes:**\n• Days are counted from midnight to midnight\n• Partial days count as full days\n• Travel days count toward the limit\n• The window rolls forward each day\n\n**Example:**\nIf you spent 45 days in France in the last 180 days, you have 45 days remaining in your current window.",
